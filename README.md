🛠️ Data Processing & Analysis Steps

•	Added a “Year” Column
  Extracted the year from date values using Excel’s YEAR() function for aggregation purposes.
•	Cleaned & Organized Dataset
  Handled missing values appropriately.
  Focused the analysis on Annual Average Temperature only, removing unrelated columns.
•	Generated Pivot Table
  Aggregated average temperature by year.
  Calculated a 7-Year Moving Average (7YMAVG) to smooth fluctuations and highlight long-term shifts.
•	Visualized the Data
  Created line charts comparing:
  Annual Average Temperature
  7-Year Moving Average
Added trendlines with axis labels, legends, and chart titles to improve clarity.
